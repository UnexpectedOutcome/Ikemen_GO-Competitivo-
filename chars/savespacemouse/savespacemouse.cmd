; Please define Anim 74140108 in your AIR file if AND ONLY IF you place these
; 7 Hold Button commands immediately after the 11 Single Button and Hold Dir
; commands at the very top of your CMD list, as demonstrated here.
; In this version of the AI code, these commands are only used by the XOR
; method, and thus are optional.  But there remains a possibility that a
; future version of the helper method might be helped by having these
; commands placed here, and Anim 74140108 would then be used to indicate
; that a partner character has a compatible CMD.

; Note that if you make any changes to the basic one-button or recovery
; commands, you'll need to make the same changes to their matching commands here
; and/or in the XOR VarSet controller.  That includes things like, for example:
;  * changing the recovery command to use a different combination of buttons.
;  * renaming the b button command as "d", or the start button command as "s".
;  * switching the button names around, e.g. so button y triggers "a" and button a triggers "y".
;  * having more than one way to trigger the same command name.
; If you understand how the XOR method works, the proper changes should be obvious.
; If you don't understand it, then simply disable the lines in the XOR VarSet
; controller that correspond to the commands you've altered.

; Here add matching commands for any moves that must never be used randomly
; by the computer, such as suicide moves and super moves, and add the pairs
; to the XOR VarSet controller in State -3.

; If you're desperate to make sure that the AI always gets turned on as soon
; as possible, you can add more equivalents for your own commands here too,
; and add to the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly.  You should
; use button-only commands before using any commands with directional
; components, as the latter apparently doesn't work in Linux Mugen 2002.04.14.

; And of course, if you've run out of unique command labels (Mugen allows
; 128), you can remove as many of these as you want.  You'll of course need
; to modify the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly, but Mugen
; will let you know if you forget to do so. :)

; 2. State entry
; --------------
; This is where you define what commands bring you to what states.
;
; Each state entry block looks like:
;   [State -1, Label]           ;Change Label to any name you want to use to
;                               ;identify the state with.
;   type = ChangeState          ;Don't change this
;   value = new_state_number
;   trigger1 = command = command_name
;   . . .  (any additional triggers)
;
; - new_state_number is the number of the state to change to
; - command_name is the name of the command (from the section above)
; - Useful triggers to know:
;   - statetype
;       S, C or A : current state-type of player (stand, crouch, air)
;   - ctrl
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player has control. Unless "interrupting" another
;                move, you'll want ctrl = 1
;   - stateno
;       number of state player is in - useful for "move interrupts"
;   - movecontact
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player's last attack touched the opponent
;                useful for "move interrupts"
;
; Note: The order of state entry is important.
;   State entry with a certain command must come before another state
;   entry with a command that is the subset of the first.  
;   For example, command "fwd_a" must be listed before "a", and
;   "fwd_ab" should come before both of the others.
;
; For reference on triggers, see CNS documentation.
;
; Just for your information (skip if you're not interested):
; This part is an extension of the CNS. "State -1" is a special state
; that is executed once every game-tick, regardless of what other state
; you are in.
